### Introduction

XMOS is the designer and manufacturer of a family of microcontrollers offering a fast 32b CPU with an interesting concurrency model based on hardware-supported threading.

Their lowest cost devboard is the XCARD XK-1A, which, at $60 offers you _two_ XS-L1 uCs, one in TQ128 on a breakout, and the other in TQ64 complete with a high-speed USB transceiver and 13MHz crystal.

XMOS intends for the USB-enabled device to be used as a debug & commmunication gateway for the second chip, but the runtime loading of application code means that it can, theoretically, be used as a general purpose devboard for the creation of USB-enabled XMOS devices. 

XMOS provides decent documentation for the bootloader, but doesn't offer a general-purpose tool for loading user-specific firmware onto the device. 

This project is that missing piece.

CAVEAT: all pins on all four-bit ports cannot be used in applications using XUD, XMOS's USB stack. See the [XS-1 Design Guide](http://www.xmos.com/download/public/XS1-L-Hardware-Design-Checklist%28X6277C%29.pdf) for details.
